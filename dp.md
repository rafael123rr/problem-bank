Dynamic Programming
===================
Dynamic Programming (DP) is to plan the best solution dynamically by using the
result of solved subproblems. When we are solving DP problems, we need to think
about the recurrence relation: how is knowing the results of solved subproblems
going to help.


DP problems can be solved recursively or iteratively. The iterative solutions
usually have performance advantages, however, the overhead of the recursive
approach is often not significant, and code tends to be easier to write.
